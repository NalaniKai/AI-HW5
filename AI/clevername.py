                Game is requesting a move from the player. (GameState)
          attackingAnt - A clone of the ant currently making the attack. (Ant)
          enemyLocation - A list of coordinate locations for valid attacks
            (i.e. enemies within range) ([list of 2-tuples of ints])

        Return: A coordinate that matches one of the entries of enemyLocations.
